# optionstocksmachines
This repository contains some of the code behind the blog www.optionstocksmachines.com. At the moment, it is mostly the custom modules and functions that we use frequently on the blog. Most of the code that drives the analysis for each post remains at the bottom of the post. But we are in the process of copying much of that over to this repository. 

The blog itself was created using blogdown and the Mainroad theme from Hugo. Initially, all the code was written, predictably, in R. In May 2020, we started providing the same analysis and output in Python. Going forward, we'll predominantly work in one language or the other for each post, but will try, when time permits, to provide the same analysis in the other language.
